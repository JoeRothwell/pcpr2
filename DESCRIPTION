Description: Performs the Principal Component Partial R-squared method (PC-PR2) on omics data and 
    corresponding metadata. PC-PR2 is a statistical method, developed by Fages et al. (2014), that 
    investigates sources of variability in metabolomics or other omics data. It combines features 
    of principal component analysis and multivariable linear regression. The input is X, a complete 
    matrix of omics data and Y, a corresponding data frame of subject metadata. The output is the 
    proportion of variation in the omics data attributed to each Y-variable.
